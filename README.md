# Package-dfply-Exploration
R is generally preferred over Python for data munging and data cleaning tasks because of the presence of packages such as tidyr, dplyr, etc. In this repository me and my friend Aravind Gunavelu Mohan explore dfply package in Python 3.0 which is similar to dplyr in R. It supports chaining of functions using the pipeline operator ">>" which makes it very convinient to use. The package has a lot of functionality like dplyr but there are a few limitations we came across which we highlight here.
